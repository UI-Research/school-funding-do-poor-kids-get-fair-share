HEADER
I’d like more space between first section of text and the two column layout, at least 40px. I wonder if we should just always have a two column? Without seeing the text it’s kinda hard to answer that. If it truly feels like a intro and not simply the first few paragraphs of a story then I think one column is fine and I’d like to adjust the font size and style. 
At 1200px wide the margins feel too tight (15px) — increase to 40px, might not be the case on a wider screen and right now since I’m living on just the laptop and not a monitor I can’t compare.

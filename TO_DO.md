HEADER
I’d like more space between first section of text and the two column layout, at least 40px. I wonder if we should just always have a two column? Without seeing the text it’s kinda hard to answer that. If it truly feels like a intro and not simply the first few paragraphs of a story then I think one column is fine and I’d like to adjust the font size and style. 
At 1200px wide the margins feel too tight (15px) — increase to 40px, might not be the case on a wider screen and right now since I’m living on just the laptop and not a monitor I can’t compare.

SECOND SECTION
On mobile there are some spacing issues with florida and new york, mostly florida, I want to reduce the space between chart and state shape. Is NY really that large compared to FL? (I want to make NY smaller)

THIRD SECTION
On mobile just below 800px in this section I see those blue buttons appear but only underneath the scrolling text so I want to touch them but I can’t. This doesn’t happen to me on phone sizes.

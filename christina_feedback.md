Been thinking about this today and playing with it. Here are my thoughts. I’m not ready yet to layout really straightforward this pixel size and this font style without chatting further so I figured I could send along my reactions and then we could go from there.

HEADER
I’d like more space between first section of text and the two column layout, at least 40px. I wonder if we should just always have a two column? Without seeing the text it’s kinda hard to answer that. If it truly feels like a intro and not simply the first few paragraphs of a story then I think one column is fine and I’d like to adjust the font size and style. 
At 1200px wide the margins feel too tight (15px) — increase to 40px, might not be the case on a wider screen and right now since I’m living on just the laptop and not a monitor I can’t compare.

FIRST SECTION
I have feelings about the first graphics and the color and tooltip. Was working on that this morning and I think we should probably do a video chat so that I really understand what the tooltip needs to do.

One more thing I wanted to highlight in the first section. I think some of the states are cut off in this display (1111px wide by 681px height). Just a heads up.


SECOND SECTION
let’s bring the key down a bit to align with top of the state shapes
Can we angle new york a bit, just a smudge to give some breathing room to the second bar in the bar chart that is measuring percentage of families with children 5-17 in poverty? If not we need to make the state shapes just a bit smaller. I like the way they are looking, how they interact with the charts but we don’t want them to be airy on one end and tight on another.
On mobile there are some spacing issues with florida and new york, mostly florida, I want to reduce the space between chart and state shape. Is NY really that large compared to FL? (I want to make NY smaller)

THIRD SECTION
Chart that aligns with “Change over with controls” :
The rollover looks nice. let’s reduce the opacity so that it’s clearer to read the tooltip.
On mobile just below 800px in this section I see those blue buttons appear but only underneath the scrolling text so I want to touch them but I can’t. This doesn’t happen to me on phone sizes.
